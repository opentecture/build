# Roadmap

Opentecture is a practical exploration in
modular systems patterns, open building standards,  and modern fabrication techniques.

---

Opentecture, like any project, given a point time, exists along one or more vectors with a trajectory. The goal of this Roadmap document is to convey the direction, and potential points along the path.

A key challenge will be integrating feedback openly and effectively.
Accordingly, our processes are expected to evolve.

## Milestones

The initial goal is design a modular home
at model-scale
using 3d printing methods.

#### Design initial 3d Component library

Design OpenStandards compatible parts to compose Structure 1 using Blender of 3d tool of choice. The preferred format .stl to start.

This is the beginning of the Opentecture Component library.

#### 3d printed prototype

1:100 3d printed scale model of Structure1 based on
3d parts designed.

#### Structure1

1 room, kitchen-ette, bathroom

#### Structure2

2 room, kitchen, bathroom

#### Beyond

Ideas:

* A component registry
* 3d printing service partnerships
* a live model in a TBD location

We'll figure it out.
